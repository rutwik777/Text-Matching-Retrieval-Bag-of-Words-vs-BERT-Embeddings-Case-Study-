Monetary policy \nReducing interest rates to stimulate economic activity and increase AD. Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing. This encourages households to spend. Also, it is cheaper for firms to finance investment so investment should rise. If successful, lower interest rates should increase aggregate demand, and in the long-term, increase long-run aggregate supply.\nHowever, lower interest rates may not always cause higher growth. If confidence is very low, firms may still be reluctant to invest.\nAlso, there is a limit to how much monetary policy can increase growth. If the economy is close to full capacity, then rising AD will cause inflation and the growth will be unsustainable.\nSee more at Monetary policy\n3.

Some countries very rich in resources have economic growth based on production and export of raw materials. For example, Saudi Arabia (oil), Venezuela (oil), Cuba (sugar) Congo (oil and natural resources). Whilst export of raw materials can increase wealth, it can also cause problems. The resource curse states countries which have growth based on raw materials may struggle in long-term, as raw material industries crowd out other manufacturing industries and make the economic growth more volatile – depending on fluctuating prices.\nLong-run trend rate of economic growth\nThe long-run trend rate is the average sustainable rate of growth over a period of time.

For example, the UK no longer has a comparative advantage in many manufacturing industries, Developing countries now have an advantage due to lower labour costs. This process can lead to temporary structural unemployment as unemployed workers struggle to gain employment in new industries.\nA problem in US and UK is that many workers feel left behind by the process of globalisation. They feel globalisation enables firms to make more profit, but workers struggle to find new employment which matches their previous jobs in turns of job security, pay and sense of loyalty."]

      "responses": ["Some limitations of monetary policy include:\nLiquidity Trap – This occurs when a cut in interest rates fail to stimulate economic activity. e.g. because of low confidence or banks don’t want to pass base rate cut onto consumers.\nDifficult to control many objectives with one tool – interest rates. For example, a rise in oil prices causes cost-push inflation and lower growth. The Bank could increase interest rates to reduce inflation, but, it would cause economic growth to fall as well. In 2009, inflation rose to rising oil prices, but the economy was also in recession; the Bank decided to ‘allow’ the temporary inflation and concentrate on economic recovery.\nChanging interest rates affects the exchange rate. Tight monetary policy causes an appreciation in the exchange rate which will make exports less competitive.\nInterest rates may affect some parts of the economy more than others. e.g. higher interest rates increase the disposable income of people with savings. But, could cause homeowners to be unable to afford their mortgages.\nTime lags – If the Bank of England change base rates, it can take up to 18 months for the effects to filter through the economy. For example, if people have a two-year fixed mortgage, they will not notice until they remortgage. This means the Bank needs to predict future inflation so that they can change interest rates in anticipation."]

      "responses": ["In the period 1997-2007, monetary policy effectively kept economic growth and inflation stable. This was because cost-push inflation was low and the independent Bank of England was successful in preventing growth exceeding the long-run trend rate.\nHowever, in the great moderation, despite low inflation, there were imbalances in the economy – such as rising house prices and boom in credit. This shows the limit of monetary policy in preventing a credit bubble.\n2007-2011\nBetween 2007 and 2011, monetary policy became much more difficult. This was because of:\nCost-push inflation and recession. In 2008 and 2011, the UK experienced a rise in CPI inflation to over 5%. (see: cost push inflation) Yet, at the same time, economic growth was very low or negative. This present the Bank of England with a difficulty. On the one hand, inflation is above their target so they should consider raising interest rates. However, with a depressed economy, the economy needs the opposite.\nLiquidity Trap. In 2008, the economy was in a liquidity trap. Cutting interest rates to zero, failed to boost spending and economic growth. Therefore, the Bank of England were forced to pursue quantitative easing."]
