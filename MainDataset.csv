QA,What Are The Roles Of An Economist?,"The most crucial role of an economist is to structure the methods to gather and analyse socio-economic and financial data of an organization. Based on the collected data, an economist would build future economic models and predict the ways to earn profit. Besides that, an economist would analyse the current economic trends and study the gradual shifts in policies. Moreover, an economist has to structure the financial policy of an organization."
QA,What Are The Qualities That An Economist Need To Be Successful,"The primary quality that an economist should have is the power of analytical thinking. An economist’s job is majorly data driven. Hence, a great sense of calculation would help in that job. Apart from that, he/she must have a sound knowledge on the current political and economic scenario of a nation. This would help in structuring the future goals of an organization, seamlessly. A sense of policy making and a good communication skill would further help in the job role."
QA,What are Daily Routine As An Economist?,"As an economist my daily job would include financial planning, studying the economic graphs on a daily basis. Apart from that, I would research on historic and present economic data and structure the economic policy of my organization. I would also work on balancing out the existing economic resources to spend them the right way so that my organization stays at profit."
QA,What Kind Of Mindset and Strategies Required For Economist?,"An economist’s job lies on the foundation of strategies. The primary strategy is to plan out economic structure in a way that serves profit to the organization. Apart from that, keeping all the data regarding previous and past economic years helps to predict the future. Another strategy is to study the changing market scenario according to the national economic policies. Besides these strategies, an analytical mind with sharp insights about the economy will help to go a long way."
QA,What Do You Know About “The Invisible Hand” That Economists Refers To?,The invisible hand is basically used as a metaphor to define an invisible force that is responsible for moving the free market economy.
QA,What is Positive Economics?,"Positive Economics involves objective analysis and describes what is true about the world. It typically involves analysis of data, and often relies on econometric methods. It describes and quantifies the world. Positive statements are generally falsifiable and do not involve a value judgment. They will almost always rely on researcher skill and judgement, in terms of what data is use, how things are measured, what econometric methods are used"
QA,What is Normative Economics?,"Normative economics considers what should be true about the world, and often relies on value-judgments and requires us to take a view about the world. However, normative economics differs from pure ideological or political statements in that it is based on economics methods. It will typically involve modelling assumptions, but these can be clearly stated."
QA,Which global trends will shape the world economy in the next ten years?,"They should list anything from the fields of politics, energy, or technology and demonstrate the causal link between global trends and economic impact."
QA,What Does Economics Study?,"Economics is the science that studies how people and societies make decisions that allow them to get the most out of their limited resources. Because every country, every business and every person deals with constraints and limitations, economics is literally everywhere."
QA,Why should we care about Economics?,"Economics gets to the heart of these issues, analysing individual and firm behaviour, as well as social and political institutions, to see how well they perform at converting humanity’s limited resources into the goods and services that best satisfy human wants and needs."
QA,How would you ensure that you effectively communicate economic data?,By making efforts to translate technical information in consumable ways. Look for the use of data visualization when communicating data
General,Microeconomics,"Macroeconomics focuses on individual people and individual businesses. For individuals, it explains how they behave when faced with decisions about where to spend their money or how to invest their savings. For businesses, it explains how profit-maximizing firms behave individually, as well as when competing against each other in markets."
General,Macroeconomics,"Macroeconomics looks at the economy as an organic whole, concentrating on factors such as interest rates, inflation, and unemployment. It also encompasses the study of economic growth and the methods governments use to try to moderate the harm caused by recessions."
General,Local economies,"When we think about a local economy, we’re referring to the interconnected markets and networks within a particular community. The local government, organisations, businesses, and people all contribute to this economy. Local businesses may purchase their raw materials from sellers who are nearby. These sellers may get grants or tax relief from local councils or governments. People in the area pay tax, work for businesses, and purchase goods and services."
General,National economies,"we’re referring to a system for distributing scarce resources. An economy, they suggest, is based on the fact that resources, such as workers, land and raw materials, are limited. Demand, however, is infinite. Although this principle of distributing scarce resources is at the heart of any economy, national governments often have radically different approaches to how they mould and manufacture a nation’s economy."
General,The global economy,"The world economy (also known as the global economy) refers to the economy of all humans of the world. This definition includes the various economic systems and activities that take place within and between nations. This broad scope captures the exchange of capital (money and assets) as well as the consumption and production of goods. Thanks to globalisation, international trade, finance and investment all help to power the world’s economy"
General,Feudalism,"This type of economic system was used in the Middle Ages. Essentially a king or ruler ‘owned’ all of the lands in a particular area. That ruler would then allocate land to certain nobles who fought for them. Regular people worked the nobles’ land, paying tax by means of products and services (such as food and farming) in exchange for protection."
General,Capitalism,"Most economies around the world today follow a capitalist system. One of the key characteristics of a capitalist economy is that private entities (as opposed to state-owned) control property and production in accord with their interests. In capitalism, supply and demand mean that market prices can be set to serve the interest of the wider society. Another stand-out feature of a capitalist economy is that there is a motivation to make a profit. Examples of capitalist economies include the US, UK, and Australia."
General,Socialism,"While in capitalism, private companies own the means of production, in socialism, everything is owned by the state or the public. Rather than working for the profit of the individual, everyone works for wealth that is distributed among the people. Rather than supply and demand setting prices and the production of goods, in a socialist economy, products and services are produced based on usage value – the needs of society. Examples of socialist economies include North Korea and The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka."
General,Communism,"Much like with socialism, a communist economy aims for ownership of the means of production by the community. It aims to create a classless society where everyone contributes and takes out according to their ability and needs. However, this often comes at the expense of individual freedoms. Examples of communist countries today include China, Cuba and Vietnam"
General,Command markets,"At this extreme, all the factors of production are controlled by the state. This means: What to produce is determined by government preferences, How to produce is determined by the government and their employees, For whom to produce is determined by government preferences"
General,Free markets,"At the other end of the spectrum are free-market economies. Rather than the government controlling decisions, the factors of production are decided by the consumer and producer and usually depend on money. This means: What to produce is determined by consumers’ preferences, How to produce is determined by producers seeking profit, For whom to produce is determined by purchasing power"
General,Mixed markets,"At the middle of the spectrum is a mixed market – a compromise between the other extremes. This means that there is some level of government intervention, usually setting boundaries in which the free market can operate. This means: What to produce is determined by consumers’ preferences and partly by the government, How to produce is determined by producers seeking profits and partly by the government, For whom to produce is determined by purchasing power and partly by government preferences."
General,Other economy types,"As we’ve seen, there are different levels at which economies operate. Whether at a local, national or international level, the way we organise our markets and distribute resources can vary considerably. That’s why you’ll often see different phrases related to the economy."
General,Green Economy,"An economy with the aim of developing sustainably without damaging the environment.  Often, this means the economy is focused on being low-carbon, using resources efficiently, and is socially inclusive."
General,Digital Economy,"An economy based on computers and the internet. In the modern world, the digital economy is increasingly a part of the traditional economy. People and devices around the world now form an interconnected web, where trade and commerce are possible at the press of a button."
General,Gig Economy,"Another modern aspect of the wider economy is the gig economy. Here, the labour market is made up of freelancers and short-term contracts rather than permanent jobs. It gives flexibility to employers and employees, but it can make career progression more difficult"
QA,How an economy forms?,"an economy is formed whenever a group of people combine their skills, interests, and desire to trade with others. Essentially, when people start to trade because they think it will make them better off, an economic market forms. households, businesses, and governments, along with the resource market and product market, form the basis of an economy. "
QA,forces that impact an economy ," As we explore in our open step on economic factors, some of the aspects that influence an economy include growth, unemployment rates, inflation, interest and exchange rates, and commodity (oil, steel, gold, etc) prices. These factors affect the income and purchasing power of households and organisations. When we measure the success of a national economy, we talk in terms of gross domestic product – the value of the country’s finished goods and services in a specific time period."
General,Living costs,"The cost of living is tied closely to the economy. It’s defined as the amount of money needed to cover basic expenses such as food, housing and taxes. This cost is measured by the inflation rate. As goods and services cost more, the power of a unit of currency lessens."
General,Employment rates," A booming economy will also mean that rates of employment increase. As more goods and services (resources) are in demand, more people are needed to provide them, creating more jobs. The same is true of the opposite – when demand is low, there are fewer jobs available."
General,Government spending,"The performance of a country’s economy will impact the policies and spending of the government. As businesses make more money and pay more tax, there is improved cash flow, allowing the government to invest in infrastructure and services."
General,Quality of life,"As a country’s economy grows, there are more resources available to spend on sectors such as education and healthcare. What’s more, it means there are more jobs available, a reduction in poverty, and overall improved wellbeing for the people in that economy. At least, in theory."
Review,,"So how does an economy work? Well, it’s complicated. However, in essence, economies work by distributing scarce resources among individuals and entities. A series of markets where goods and services are exchanged, facilitated by capital, combine to make an economy. These networks exist at a local, national and international level. Economies can take many different forms, focus on various priorities, and have different levels of government intervention. On both a micro and macro level, there are factors that determine how well or badly an economy performs. Similarly, our lives are affected by the various ebbs and flows of the systems we’re a part of. Learning about the economy can encourage you to understand the various forces that impact it"
